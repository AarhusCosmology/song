   * The rescaling is asymmetrical in k1<->k2 because it contains theta_1 but not theta_2.
   * It follows that the rescaling breaks the (k1,k2) symmetry of the transfer functions.
   * The effect of exchanging k1 with k2 in the rescaled source function, however, is very
   * simple (eq. 6.47):

   * S_rescaled(k2,k1,k3) = S_rescaled(k1,k2,k3) *  (-1)^m * (k2/k1)^m

   * Array used to access the second-order massless hierarchies in the perturbations2.c module.
   *
   * In SONG, we decompose the angular dependence of the perturbations into spherical harmonics.
   * This allows to treat the Boltzmann equation numerically by expressing it as a hierarchy of
   * equations that depend on the harmonic indices (l,m). The perturbations themselves form a
   * hierarchy of moments, each with its own (l,m) indices.
   * 
   * To write this information in terms of C arrays, we need to create a correspondence between the
   * (l,m) indices and a sequence of integers starting from zero. This is the same problem of
   * compressing a square matrix in a 1D array, with the difference that here the matrix is ragged,
   * because the m direction depends on the considered l.
   * 
   * The multipole index l can assumes all the values between 0 and l_max, the maximum multipole
   * required in this module. The azimuthal index m, on the other hand, has two constraints:
   * it needs to be smaller or equal than l, and it must be contained in ppt2->m.
   * 
   * We encode all this information in the array ppt2->lm_array[l][index_m]. To ease the notation,
   * we define a shorthand, lm(l,m). This will be used ubiquitously in perturbations2.c to access
   * the perturbations in many arrays; for example, the (l,m) multipole of the photon hierarchy is
   * acessed as:
   * 
   *   ppw2->pv->y[ppw2->pv->index_pt2_monopole_g + lm(l,m)]
   *   ppw2->pv->dy[ppw2->pv->index_pt2_monopole_g + lm(l,m)]
   * 
   * while the line of sight source for the (l,m) multipole of the E-modes is in
   * 
   *   ppt2->sources[ppt2>index_tp2_E + lm(l,m)].
   * 
   * Be careful accessing lm(l,m). If either l or m do not satisfy the constraints (0<=l<=l_max,
   * m<=l, m in ppt2->m), you will encounter segmentation faults or unexpected behaviour. The
   * lm(l,m) macro should be used only inside constrained (l,m) loops or inside if blocks.

   * into its intensity (I), E-mode polarisation (E) and B-mode polarisation (B) parts according
   * to eq. 2.10 of arXiv:1401.3296:
   * 
   *   P[-+](l,m) = P_E(l,m) - i P_B(l,m)
   *   P[+-](l,m) = P_E(l,m) + i P_B(l,m)
   *   1/2 * (P[++] + P[--])(l,m)  =  P_I(l,m)
   * 
   * If P[ab] is a product in helicity space, 
   * 
   *   P[ab] = 1/2 (X[ac]*Y[cb] + Y[ac]*X[cb]),
   * 
   * then its I, E and B components can be inferred, respectively, by eq. 3.9, 3.7 and 3.6 of
   * the same reference:

   * 
   * where: 
   * 
   *  - We are neglecting the first-order B-modes.
   *  - The symbol (    | ) denotes a Clebsch-Gordan symbol.
   *  - L = l-l1-l2.
   *  - The indices (l1,l2,m1,m2) are summed.
   *  - The indices (l,m) are free.
   *  - The sums in P_I and P_E vanish for odd values of L because the intensity and E-mode fields
   *    have even parity. The B-mode field instead has odd parity. This property also ensures
   *    that both the i^L and i^(L-1) factors are real-valued.
   *  - With respect to arXiv:1401.3296 we have a -2 factor; this counters the fact that the expressions
   *    in that reference were for the quadratic term -1/2*delta*delta rather than for a generic X*Y.
   *    
   * In what follows, we compute the general coupling coefficients given by
   * 
   *       prefactor * ( l1   l2 |  l  ) * (  l1   l2 |  l  )
   *                   ( 0    F  |  F  )   (  m1   m2 |  m  ) ,
   * 
   * for F=0 (intensity) or F=2 (E and B-mode polarisation). We store the result in the array
   * ppt2->coupling_coefficients[index_pf][lm][l1][m1-m1_min][l2], where index_pf refers to
   * the considered field (I,E,B...). Note that, in terms of 3j symbols, the coefficients read: 
   *       
   *       prefactor * (-1)^m * (2*l+1) * ( l1   l2   l  ) * (  l1   l2   l  )
   *                                      ( 0    F   -F  )   (  m1   m2  -m  )
   * 
   * The prefactor for the I,E,B fields can be read from the equations shown above:
   * 
   *       prefactor(I) = +1 * i^L
   *       prefactor(E) = +2 * i^L
   *       prefactor(B) = +2 * i^(L-1)
   * 
   * where L=l-l1-l2. For the even-parity fields (I and E) L is always even, while
   * for the odd-parity ones (B) it is odd. Therefore, the prefactors are always

   *
   * CLASS adopts a number of such approximations. The idea is to split the integration

   *   the formalism of Pitrou 2011 (http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.0546).

   *   second order, we generalise the formalism of Blas, Lesgourgues and Tram 2011
   *   (Sec. 4 of http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2933).
   *
   * - The no-radiation approximation (NRA), a poor man's version of the RSA,
