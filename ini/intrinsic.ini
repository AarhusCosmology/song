## Example input file to compute the intrinsic bispectrum of the cosmic
## microwave background with SONG, and to measure its observability.
##
## The bispectrum will be computed in temperature and polarisation, using the LCDM
## cosmological model with Planck parameters. Its observability will be estimated
## using the Fisher formalism, the resulting Fisher matrix printed to screen.
##
## To make a quick test run to check that SONG runs fine, execute:
##     ./song ini/intrinsic.ini pre/quick_song_run.pre.
## The computation should take less than a minute, but the result will have
## an extremely small angular resolution (l_max=100); however, it is a good 
## test for SONG as all its modules will be executed.
##
## To obtain a physically relevant result, use any of the .pre files in the 'pre'
## directory. For example, for a low precision run try:
##     ./song ini/intrinsic.ini pre/sn_pol_10percent_lmax2000.pre
## The resulting signal-to-noise (sn) will have a moderate angular resolution
## (l_max=2000) and will be accurate to the 10% level for both temperature and
## polarisation. This calculation is likely to take a couple of hours on an 8-core
## machine.
##
## To speed up the computation of the intrinsic bispectrum, exclude polarisation
## (eBisp) from the output field below. You can then expect to obtain a
## 10%-precise result in less than an hour on an 8-core machine by running:
##     ./song ini/intrinsic.ini pre/sn_t_10percent_lmax2000.pre
##
## To fully use the parallelisation, make sure that the openmp flags are enabled
## in the makefile and that the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable is set to
## whatever number of cores you want to use.
##
## This file mixes CLASS and SONG parameters. For a more detailed description of
## each parameter, refer to ini/explanatory.ini in the SONG folder and to
## explanatory.ini in the CLASS folder.
